    Local Persistence Module is build on the MariaDB and uses the MariaDB JDBC Connector
    The actual database can be hosted on the local machine or on a network accessible server
    The idea is to use Local Persistence as a proof of concept and then speerate the module into two seperate modules,
    One that will be a plug-in to the Desktop App and the second will be a standalone programm that will run as a
    server, these two modules would then take over network communications without exposing the Database to the internet.
